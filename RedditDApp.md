# Reddit DApp

Yep, let's messaging is cool, but let's make something real cool. I want to make Reddit DApp and show how to easy make it on Crypti.

First of all let's understand what need:

  * List of boards.
  * Posts to boards: name, link, link to board.
  * Comments: text, link to post.
  * Vote: positive and negative. To send vote, let's choose 0,00001 XCR for one vote/disvote. If vote is positive - fee for this vote go to author of post, if negative - it's go to dapp master nodes.
 
Let's start from posts and list of boards.
